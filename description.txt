Let's say that each minute we are going to send a GET request to get an update if the total announcemount count has changed
once this is a hit

we sort the list and take the first elemnt -> the newest listing
23--------------------------




extract " alle announcer (n)"

remember n from first request

request one minute later

check if n matches,
if it does
nothing new
if there is a n+1 then there is a new new item

do diff = new_n - old_n = 8-6 = 2 new listings
sort and send them
